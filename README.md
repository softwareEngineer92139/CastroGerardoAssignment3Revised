Finding out the most frequently occurring value in an array of numbers. As an example, we can think of these values as coins, with 
pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters or other unknown denomination. Provide functions and arrays accordinly. I had this project 
revised because I incorporated functions to the project. I devided it into methods or function to practice this learning opportunity.
In this project, I use arrays and its index numbers. A variable is created to hold the set of coin denominations. I like using the switch
statement, in this case to count appropriately. The output is a summary of the coin denomations. Finally, finding the most frequently occuring
count in the list.
